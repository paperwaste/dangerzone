1. Build greedy player (no tree)
	longest jump path, or
	heuristic placement
2. x-ply minimax (no alpha-beta pruning)
3. a-b pruning
4. machinbne learn util function parameters


Ecal features
	untakable positions
	safe for now positions
	set up jump chain? hard
	encapsulate security with a nominal attribute:
		"number of required adjacent DEAD or SELF to fully secure THIS piecei, and how many ways can it be done"
			-> because if my piece needs 1 more, but there are 2 ways to secure it, the other player only has one move and can't take it without us letting them.
		"number of adjacent SELF tokens reinforced by this placement"
	
	"formations" that serve offensive or defensive functions?
		chains vs security

Game invariants
	a secure position cannot become insecure later
